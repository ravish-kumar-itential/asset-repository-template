# Asset Repository Template

A template repository that demonstrates how to manage Itential Platform assets using Git and automatic promotion through CI/CD pipelines. Use this as a starting point to version-control your asset bundles and automate deployments across environments.

> **Currently supported:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD
>
> **Coming soon:** Bitbucket Pipelines, Jenkins

## How It Works

This repository uses a tag-based promotion model. CI/CD pipelines execute the shared scripts in `pipelines/scripts/` to automatically version, tag, and deploy assets across environments.

> **Note:** Throughout this documentation, `main` is used as the default branch name. If your repository uses `master`, substitute `master` wherever `main` appears.

### Automatic Versioning

The `auto-rc-tag` step in the diagram above uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to determine the next semantic version. The script scans all commit messages since the last production tag and picks the highest-priority bump:

| Bump Type | Commit Prefix | Example | Version Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Major** | `feat!:` or `feat(scope)!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | `feat!: redesign asset schema` | `v1.2.3` → `v2.0.0` |
| **Minor** | `feat:` or `feat(scope):` | `feat: add lifecycle manager support` | `v1.2.3` → `v1.3.0` |
| **Patch** | Anything else (`fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.) | `fix: correct automation import` | `v1.2.3` → `v1.2.4` |

If any commit in the range is a breaking change, the bump is **major** regardless of other commits. If no `feat` or breaking change commits are found, the bump defaults to **patch**.

Once the version is determined, the script creates a release candidate tag (e.g., `v1.3.0-rc.1`). If an RC tag for that version already exists then the RC number is incremented (e.g., `v1.3.0-rc.2`).

### `Asset Bundle/`

An example asset bundle that shows the expected directory layout. It includes sample assets for each supported Itential Platform application:

- **`studio/`** — Studio project files (`.project.json`)
- **`operations_manager/`** — Operations Manager automation files (`.automation.json`)
- **`lifecycle_manager/`** — Lifecycle Manager resource model files (`.model.json`)
- **`configuration_manager/`** — Configuration Manager golden config files (`.gctree.json`)

You can add multiple bundles at the repo root and the deploy script will auto-discover them.

### `pipelines/`

Contains CI/CD pipeline definitions organized by platform, along with shared scripts that are called by each pipeline.

**`pipelines/scripts/`** — Shared scripts used across all platforms:

- **`deploy.py`** — Connects to an Itential Platform instance and imports all discovered assets from the repository. Currently supports Studio projects and Operations Manager automations. Support for Lifecycle Manager and Configuration Manager assets is coming soon.
- **`bump-version.sh`** — Calculates the next semantic version based on commit messages and creates release candidate tags

**Platform-specific pipeline directories:**

Each platform directory contains workflow/pipeline definitions and a README with setup and usage instructions for that CI/CD system.

| Directory | Platform | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`pipelines/github/`](pipelines/github) | GitHub Actions | Available |
| [`pipelines/gitlab/`](pipelines/gitlab) | GitLab CI/CD | Available |
| `pipelines/bitbucket/` | Bitbucket Pipelines | Coming soon |
| `pipelines/jenkins/` | Jenkins | Coming soon |

See the README in each platform directory for setup and deployment instructions.

## Adding a New Asset Bundle

1. Create a new directory at the repo root — not nested inside other directories — (e.g., `My Use Case Bundle/`)
2. Add subdirectories for each asset type and place your exported JSON files inside
3. Commit and push to your develop branch

```text
My Use Case Bundle/
├── studio/
│   └── My Project.project.json
├── operations_manager/              
│   └── My Automation.automation.json
├── lifecycle_manager/               
│   └── My Resource.model.json
└── configuration_manager/           
    └── My Config.gctree.json
```

The deploy script auto-discovers any bundles matching this structure. No additional configuration is needed.
